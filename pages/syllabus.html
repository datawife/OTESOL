            <h2>Grading Procedures</h2>
     <div class="update-highlight">
                <h3>Assessment Approach</h3>
                <p>This course uses a comprehensive assessment strategy to monitor progress and evaluate learning outcomes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Diagnostic Assessment:</strong> Conducted during the first week to determine students' current proficiency levels and inform instruction</li>
                    <li><strong>Formative Assessments:</strong> Ongoing checks for understanding through quizzes, discussions, and in-class activities that provide feedback throughout the learning process</li>
                    <li><strong>Summative Assessments:</strong> End-of-unit tests, projects, and the final portfolio that evaluate cumulative learning at key points</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Assessments:</strong> Opportunities for students to reflect on their own progress and set learning goals</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This multifaceted approach ensures we capture the full picture of each student's development and can provide targeted support where needed.</p>

        NOTE: 
I reviewed my peers' submissions and comments and revised my syllabus template accordingly.

<p>
I made three additional changes and highlighted them in yellow (Prerequisites Section, Assessment Approach Section, and Student Support Section). 
<p>
A brief reflecton on this learning experience with my final syllabus template: 
I realized that templates are very helpful, as the courses one could design based on the standardized structure could vary from in-class ESL101 to a featured course that caters to a specific need/ target audience.
