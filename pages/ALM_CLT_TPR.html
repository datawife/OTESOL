        <h1>Language Teaching Superheroes: ALM, CLT & TPR Unite!</h1>
        
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> Welcome, everyone! I'm so glad you could join me today. I'm looking for the best ways to help my students not just learn English, but really use it. Let's start with introductions.</p>
        
        <p><span class="alm">ALM:</span> Hello, Teacher! I'm the Audio-Lingual Method, or ALM for short. Think of me as the coach who helps your students build strong language habits through repetition and pattern drills. I'm all about precision and muscle memory—like a cheerleader perfecting a routine!</p>
        
        <p><span class="clt">CLT:</span> And I'm Communicative Language Teaching, CLT. I'm here to make sure your students are actually communicating—not just repeating, but using language to connect, persuade, and express themselves. Think of me as the referee in a real game: the goal is to score, not to memorize the rulebook.</p>
        
        <p><span class="tpr">TPR:</span> Hi there! I'm Total Physical Response, TPR. I believe in learning by doing—literally! If you want your students to remember "stand up," "sit down," or "open the door," let's do it. Our bodies remember what our minds might forget.</p>

        <h2>Teacher:</h2>
        <p>Fascinating! ALM, you mentioned repetition and drills. How do you see your role in my classroom?</p>
        
        <p><span class="alm">ALM:</span> I'm perfect for building foundational skills, especially for beginners. Need to nail down pronunciation, basic phrases, or grammar patterns? I'll have your students repeating, substituting, and transforming sentences until they're second nature. It's like practicing scales before playing a sonata—essential for fluency!</p>
        
        <p><span class="clt">CLT:</span> But ALM, don't you think students might get bored just repeating? In the real world, no one cares if you say "I go" instead of "I am going" as long as the message gets across. I focus on meaningful interaction—role-plays, debates, and problem-solving. Language is a tool, not a test!</p>
        
        <p><span class="tpr">TPR:</span> I agree with CLT about keeping it real, but I add a twist: movement! When students act out commands or stories, they're not just listening—they're experiencing the language. It's great for beginners and advanced learners alike, and it reduces anxiety because there's no pressure to speak right away.</p>

        <h2>Teacher:</h2>
        <p>That's a great point, TPR. How would each of you handle a lesson on giving directions?</p>
        
        <p><span class="alm">ALM:</span> I'd start with a dialogue: "Turn left. Go straight. Stop at the traffic light." Students repeat, substitute, and practice until they can say it without thinking. Then, we'd do a chain drill—each student gives the next one a direction.</p>
        
        <p><span class="clt">CLT:</span> I'd turn it into a scavenger hunt! Students work in pairs: one gives directions to a hidden "treasure" in the school, and the other follows. The goal isn't perfect grammar—it's getting to the right place. They'll naturally use questions like "Is it near the library?" or "Did I miss the turn?"</p>
        
        <p><span class="tpr">TPR:</span> I'd have students be the map! Draw a giant grid on the floor, and as you call out directions, they move like game pieces. Or, they could guide a blindfolded classmate using only words. It's kinetic, memorable, and fun—no worksheets needed!</p>

        <h2>Teacher:</h2>
        <p>I love these ideas! What about assessing progress?</p>
        
        <p><span class="alm">ALM:</span> I'd use accuracy-based tests—can they produce the pattern correctly? How's their pronunciation? It's clear and measurable.</p>
        
        <p><span class="clt">CLT:</span> I'd observe how well they achieve a task. Did they successfully plan a trip together? Resolve a conflict in a role-play? Fluency and communication matter more than perfection.</p>
        
        <p><span class="tpr">TPR:</span> I'd watch for physical responses and confidence. Can they follow commands quickly? Do they volunteer to act out new words? Their bodies will show you what their minds have learned.</p>

        <h2>Teacher:</h2>
        <p>This is so helpful! Maybe I don't have to choose just one…</p>
        
        <div class="group">
            <p><span class="alm">ALM</span>, <span class="clt">CLT</span>, <span class="tpr">TPR</span> (together): Exactly! Use us all—drills for precision, tasks for communication, and movement for memory. We're a team!</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> Teamwork it is! Thank you all for your unique strengths. My students are going to love this.</p>
