        <h1>Knowledge of Language</h1>
 <h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="indie-flower-conclusion">My approach to Knowledge of Language in TESOL blends linguistic precision with communicative purpose, ensuring learners not only understand the mechanics of English but also gain the confidence and skills to use it meaningfully in real-world contexts.</div>        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Part 1: Language as a System</h2>
            <p>In my practice, I demonstrate an understanding of English as an interconnected system—phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics—and use that understanding to support ELLs' language and literacy development for success in content areas.</p>

            <p><strong>Impact on achievement:</strong> These system-focused routines are embedded in content tasks (e.g., lab reports, DBQs, math explanations), improving accuracy, comprehensibility, and the ability to access grade-level texts and tasks.</p>
<p>TESOL teachers know that language is more than grammar.TESOL teachers create several activities, resources and lessons to help English learners understand how the linguistic systems of spoken language work together to create meaning.

            <h3>How to pick methods quickly</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Beginner, multi-level online: TPR + CLT tasks + visual scaffolds; short ALM drills for pronunciation; AfL exit checks.</li>
                <li>Academic writing (EAP): Genre-based + Lexical Approach + DDL; planned FFI on cohesion and nominalization.</li>
                <li>Workplace speaking (adults): CLT + TBLT with scenarios; pronunciation/prosody focus; strategy training for repair/clarification.</li>
                <li>Content classes (K–12): SIOP/CLIL structure; cooperative learning; explicit vocabulary morphology; multimodal supports.</li>
                <li>1:1 tutoring: Needs analysis → goal-aligned mix of Lexical Approach, Focus on Form, and Pronunciation; frequent micro-assessment.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>I can use cause–effect connectors (so, therefore, as a result) to explain a science process in a paragraph.</p>
                <p>I can use past simple vs. present perfect to describe work experience in an interview.</p>
                <p>I can use hedging (might, appears to) to present claims in a discussion.</p>
