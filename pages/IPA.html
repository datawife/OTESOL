    <h1>An assessment format I might use in my classroom:</h1>
    <h2>Integrated Performance Assessment (IPA)</h2>

    <h3>Why IPA?</h3>
    <p>
        The IPA is a performance-based assessment developed by ACTFL, designed to evaluate language proficiency through authentic, real-world tasks. It aligns with the World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages (the "Five Cs": Communication, Cultures, Connections, Comparisons, and Communities) and is ideal for ESL educators seeking to move beyond traditional, discrete-point testing.
    </p>

    <h3>IPA has Three Communicative Modes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Interpretive (understanding spoken/written texts)</li>
        <li>Interpersonal (spontaneous communication)</li>
        <li>Presentational (rehearsed communication for an audience)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        IPA tasks are thematically linked, mirroring how language is used in real life—receiving information, discussing it, and creating new content.
    </p>

    <p>
        It uses real-world tasks and materials (e.g., articles, videos, podcasts) and tasks, which increases its validity.
    </p>

    <h3>IPA is almost ideal for children and adults.</h3>
    <p>
        It works great for adults due to their developed cognitive skills and pragmatic learning goals. IPA’s authenticity aligns with professional and academic needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        For children (K-12) it'd require scaffolding and age-appropriate themes (e.g., family, animals, school activities). Simplified tasks and visual supports can make IPA accessible and engaging.
    </p>

    <h3>IPA works in all teaching modes.</h3>
    <p>
        In class, it's great for interpersonal tasks (e.g., discussions, role-plays), which benefit from immediate feedback and live interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        In online or hybrid instructional settings, it suits well for interpretive and presentational tasks and adapts well to digital platforms (e.g., video submissions, discussion forums).
    </p>

    <h3>What changes would you make and why?</h3>
    <h4>For ESL:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Scaffolding for proficiency levels: simplified authentic texts, sentence frames, and visual supports for beginners. Add progressive difficulty across units, increasing complexity as students advance.</li>
        <li>Use digital platforms like <a href="https://flipgridapp.com/" target="_blank">Flipgrid</a> for asynchronous discussions or collaborative documents for presentational tasks.</li>
        <li>Use localized content that reflects students’ immediate environments and experiences.</li>
        <li>Interdisciplinary connections: Align IPA themes with other academic subjects (e.g., history, science).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        IPA can be adapted to diverse educational contexts and learner needs for ESL programs.
