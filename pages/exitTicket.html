    <h1>Formal vs. Informal Assessments: What’s the Difference?</h1>

    <p><strong>Formal Assessments</strong> are the big, official tests—think standardized exams, end-of-unit tests, or language proficiency checks. They’re usually graded, give you a score, and show how students stack up against a set standard.</p>

    <p><strong>Informal Assessments</strong> are quick, on-the-fly checks to see if students "get it." These aren’t graded and happen during class—like exit tickets, thumbs up/down, or class discussions. They help teachers adjust lessons right away based on what students understand (or don’t).</p>

    <h2>Why I Picked Exit Tickets</h2>

    <p>After checking out different ways to quickly see if students understand, I went with <strong>exit tickets</strong>. They’re a fast, easy way to wrap up a lesson and see what stuck. For example, if kids are learning to tell time, an exit ticket can show if they can read a clock <em>and</em> write about it using the right words and grammar.</p>

    <p><strong>Why Exit Tickets Work for English Learners (ELLs):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Pressure:</strong> Since it’s not graded, kids feel okay making mistakes and trying their best.</li>
        <li><strong>Double-Check Learning:</strong> I can see if they get the <em>content</em> (like reading a clock) <em>and</em> the <em>language</em> (like using "past" or "to" correctly).</li>
        <li><strong>Plan Better Lessons:</strong> The answers help me group kids for the next day—who needs more help with time, who needs practice with words, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Helps Memory:</strong> Writing down what they learned helps kids remember the key ideas and vocabulary in their minds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Created Classroom-Based Assessment: Exit Ticket</h2>
    <p><strong>Age Group:</strong> 2nd-3rd Grade<br>
    <strong>Content Area:</strong> Math (Telling Time)<br>
    <strong>Content Objective:</strong> Students will be able to read an analog clock and write the digital time.<br>
    <strong>Language Objective:</strong> Students will write a complete sentence using a time expression (e.g., "The time is...") and the correct preposition (<em>past</em> or <em>to</em>).</p>

    <h3>Math Exit Ticket</h3>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> _________________________<br>
    <strong>Date:</strong> _________________________<br>
    <strong>Today we learned about Telling Time!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>⏰ Look at the clock. Then, write 1 complete sentence to answer the question below.</strong><br>
    <strong>What time is it?</strong><br>
    ________________________________________________________<br>
    ________________________________________________________</p>
    <p><strong>Word Bank (if you need it):</strong> <em>hour, minute, hand, two, ten, fifty, past, to</em></p>

    <h2>Data Tracking Method</h2>
    <p>To track the data from these exit tickets, I’ll use a simple spreadsheet. It lets me spot trends for the whole class and individual students over time. I’ll use symbols (✅, Δ, ❌) for quick reviews.</p>

    <h3>Spreadsheet Sample: Exit Ticket Data Tracker - Telling Time</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Student Name</th>
                <th>Content Understanding (Correct Digital Time: 2:50 or 10 to 3)</th>
                <th>Language Use (Used "to" correctly in a sentence?)</th>
                <th>Notes & Follow-Up</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Maria</td>
                <td>✅</td>
                <td>✅</td>
                <td>Wrote "It is ten to three." Perfect.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Choi</td>
                <td>✅</td>
                <td>Δ</td>
                <td>Wrote "It is 2:50." Time is correct! Small group to practice the "to" and "past" language structure.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>James</td>
                <td>❌</td>
                <td>N/A</td>
                <td>Wrote "It is 2:10." Re-teach the minute hand. 1-on-1 practice.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sofia</td>
                <td>✅</td>
                <td>✅</td>
                <td>Wrote "The time is ten minutes before three o'clock." Excellent conceptual understanding and language.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Class Totals</strong></td>
                <td><strong>16/20 ✅</strong></td>
                <td><strong>12/20 ✅</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Trend:</strong> 4 students need concept review on minute hand; 8 need language support with prepositions.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><strong>Coding Key:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>✅ = Proficient:</strong> Shows understanding/accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Δ = Developing:</strong> Partial understanding or minor errors (e.g., correct time but language error).</li>
        <li><strong>❌ = Beginning:</strong> Big misunderstanding or errors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This tracking method gives a clear, quick view of both content and language skills for each student and the whole class, helping me plan the next lesson.</p>
